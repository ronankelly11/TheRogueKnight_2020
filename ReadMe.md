# Overview
The Rogue Knight is a Java based side scroller game created during my time in college. Given a basic template for a space-invaders esque game, the assignment was to take this template and implement our own game with certain features.
These features can be outlined in the GameReport.pdf.

# Running the Game
This project uses Maven to build and run the game.

After installing Maven, you can compile and run the game using the following commands:

```
mvn compile

mvn exec:java
```
